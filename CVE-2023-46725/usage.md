### Usage

Requirement: 

- Python3 with `requests` and `Pillow` library
- Setup the application with an manufacturer account (demo data can be used)

Execute:

- First run bypass server `python3 bypass_server.py`

- On server side, listen on `localhost:8888` (disable external visit)
- Change `SERVER_URL`, `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD` and `BYPASS_SERVER_URL` to match the setup
- `python poc.py`

A request will be received on server side. In this case, the full response is also returned and will be printed out.
