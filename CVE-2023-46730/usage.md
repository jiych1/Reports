### Usage

Requirement: 

- Python3 with `requests` library
- Setup the application with an account that can upload

Execute:

- On server side, listen on `localhost:8080` (disable external visit)
- Change `SERVER_URL`, `USER_NAME` and `PASSWORD` to match the setup
- `python poc.py`

A request will be received on server side. In this case, the full response is also returned and will be printed out.
